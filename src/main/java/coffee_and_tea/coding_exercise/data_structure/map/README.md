#  Data structure Map

Map provides API to associate key and value pair.
Operations provide put a key/value pair, get by key, delete by key, check if key is in map,
size of map, and whether map is empty and provides a list of keys to iterate.

Additional operations can be provided if key can be ordered (Comparable)
## Implementation

### Linked list implementation
Simple implementation to use linked list to store key/value pairs.

### Binary Search Tree implementation
Using binary search tree, an order map can be implemented.
