# Sorting Algorithms

Provide a function to sort Comparable items in a given array. 

## Selection Sort
Sorting by pick min item in array swap with sorting position each time, and increase sorting position each increment.
Complexity O(n**2), order of the items does not impact time of execution always need to go through all iterations.

## Insertion Sort


## Shell Sort

## Shuffle
Shuffle array by shuffle for each position i, randomly pick item between 0 and i, swap with item at i+1.
Helpful for testing sorts.

## Complexity

| Algorithm         | Complexity |
|------------------ | -----------|
| Selection sort    |  O(n**2)   |
| Insertion sort    |            |
| Shell sort        |            |
